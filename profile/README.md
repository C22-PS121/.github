# **[Bangkit 2022] C22-PS121 Product-Based Capstone Project**
Emergencies in Indonesia were frequently handled late such as crime, fire, and traffic accidents. This happens because information often arrives late to the authorities, causing the handling to be delayed as well. 

Therefore, we have an innovation to solve those problems. We intend to provide emergency services that are more responsive. The service is provided in the form of an application called **DANTION: Danger Detection**. 

This application can send information to the authorities consisting of personal data and the complainant‚Äôs location by using the voice recording feature, then mentioning several predetermined keywords. With this application, we hope that emergencies in Indonesia, especially crimes, fires, and traffic accidents, can be handled by the authorities more responsively.
